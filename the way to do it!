take pictures of really nice stuff and sonar and xrays and then create software to make 3d printable models of that stuff in blender. 
it will help with updating sitars and guitars to sound great even after you bought the shittiest one ever. 
same with electronic circuits! model the circuit for a rokton uds

model clothes too, everyone needs clothes so make 3d printable models of clothes and sex toys and what not. same with surfboards and then take people's
measurements with sonar and scale the clothes to fit and then boom. 3d print. 

but also gotta 3d print wax and epoxy and polyester resin. and mekp and shit like that. 

do that for everything from condenser mics and preamps to microchips and 

and then do that for everything and then we'll have a good starting point for developing circuits.
