please make ichat for android. holy hell i can't get texts on my android its really frustrating

and make bluetooth solar/ battery powered devices so i can use my android smartphone or galaxy note 10 as a sequencer for my march uds and then have the audio
play via my phone or bluetooth speakers. but i want options. 

i want to play some notes on every beat, some notes on most beats, and some notes on one beat. 

use your brains.
